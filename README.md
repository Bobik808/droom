## Get wicked on the drums

The drum sequencer is bare-bones and oldschool. Resembling a hybrid between a vinyl record and a music roll (...from space 🛸), this 16-step sequencer reflects the cyclical nature of dance rhythms and encourages the user to explore by creating patterns and altering them on the fly. Labelling is omitted to further encourage experimentation.

## Take the lead

Scroll down and uncover the polyphonic lead sequencer! Click any cell in the grid to add a note and click it again to remove it.

### ***Tip:** You can make chords by adding several notes in the same column*

Music theory not your forte? Don't worry, all the notes are already in key so you can be sure you'll never play a bum note. 😉 Click play button and see what it sounds like!

Not only can you sequence melodies and chords, you have complete control over the track's harmony! Try switching between keys and modes and see how it will transform your sequence.

Unsure how the notes will sound? Try the piano roll between the sequencer and harmony panels. The notes will sound as you click them.

## Time for some Bass

Scroll down past the lead to the bass sequencer. Like the lead, it will always stay in time and in key, except it also follows the harmony of the lead. With less to worry about, you an focus on getting that groove just right 😎
